Welcome to the Wine Country Coder Club main app repo! 

This organization will aim to bring together people who want to learn about programming, web technologies, and software development in general here in the Napa Valley.

It's up to every member to take an active role in organizing, facilitating, and maintaining both in-person meetups and this application. 
Everything is open source, and project contribution guidelines start with the following base:

 1. Make sure you pull and branch as necessary, commit often, and follow general git best practices and ettiquette.

 2. Submit pull requests for any changes you've made; DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER! 

 3. Commit messages persist forever and should be informative.

Please pull all revisions to this document below the line.
